## About Me
 I was born and raised in Greensboro, NC. I am the youngest of three siblings. I competed in track & field for 15 years, and sprinted for the Tar Heels during undergrad. I’ve always loved building and tinkering with things. I dream of making technology more intuitive, accessible, and meaningful in people's daily lives. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree in computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, spending time in nature, and hanging out with my pets, Sammy and Luna.

## My CSC340 Goals
My goal for CSC340 is to build a strong foundation in software engineering practices that I can carry into my future career. Through this course, I hope to become more confident with pair programming and the agile workflow. I also aim to sharpen my public speaking skills through our weekly presentations.
