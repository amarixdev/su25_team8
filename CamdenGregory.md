## About Me
Hello my name is Camden Gregory and I am a junior at UNCG majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in all things artistic and scientific. I enjoy playing guitar and piano in my spare time. I am passionate for surveying topics in mathematics but I got into Computer Science because its an area I knew little about and wanted to explore. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to learn in this class how to be a more efficient and effective communicator, software designer, and programmer. I am very excited to learn about the Springboot Framework as my first tech stack for software development. I am also intrested in the software engineering and design processes which are implemented in industry settings.
