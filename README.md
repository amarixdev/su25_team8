## Description 
Spartan Paradigm is a simple blog-style web application to let UNCG students
connect with one another via ideas, concepts, and observations
they have made along their academic journey. The app is designed to 
encourage collaboration and peer learning by allowing users to:

- Post blog entries

- Tag entries with subjects or topics (e.g., Physics, History, Philosophy)

- Browse and search other users' posts

- Like or comment on ideas to promote discussion

Perhaps you have hidden talents, ambitious ideas, or niche passions which can be difficult
to share with others. Spartan Paradigm provides an oppurtunity to explore and share your skills
with like-minded peers at UNCG!
